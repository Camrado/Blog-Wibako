## Why did I created it?

Eh..., I've recently learned something about Vue.js 3, and I just created this web-application (wtihout any template) for practice.

## Used technologies

- Vue CLI 3
- SCSS

## Used dependencies/plugins in Vue

- Vue Router (plugin)
- SCSS (dependencies):
  - node-sass
  - sass-loader
- For server (dependencies):
  - connect-history-api-fallback
  - express
  - express-sslify
  - serve-static
