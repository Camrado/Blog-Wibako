If you have ever taken a web development course online or in school, then you know exactly how important and crucial coding is to nearly all of the experiences we have online.",
      "So you would think something that is so widespread would be easy, right? Well, that’s where it can get a little complicated. Sometimes, people pick up coding in no time, the programming languages becoming an extension of themselves. On the other hand, a large chunk of the population view coding as a completely foreign language, which funnily enough, it is. ",
      "Let’s face facts: coding can be pretty complicated in certain situations. It doesn’t come easily to everyone, and if you feel like you’re struggling with things like Python, Java, functions, and algorithms, you aren’t alone.",

      "The tech industry is established upon the hundreds of coding languages that are used daily. But just how many coding languages are there? And how many of these programming languages should you know? These questions may have multiple answers. In this article, we will take a deep dive into the world of coding languages and figure out just how many there are and how many are necessary to learn in order to succeed in the tech industry.",
      "The easiest way to explain a programming language is by describing it as the language that computers speak. Computers cannot speak English, Chinese, Swedish, or any other languages humans use so there must be a form of communication that they can comprehend. That is where a programming language comes in.",
      "It is a formal language that consists of a set of instructions, and those instructions can be fed to a computer. They can understand the “binary” portion of the language given to them. Furthermore, programming languages allow computers to process large amounts of data and implement algorithms quickly. Here is some foreshadowing—there are many programming languages and each has its distinctive features. That still leaves the question, “Just how many are there?”.",
      "This is a very straight forward question. However, it may be impossible to give one right answer. What’s more, the number may ultimately vary depending on who you are asking. For example, the answer to this question can range from 250 to 2,500 programming languages. The most common response being reported is an average of 700 languages. The problem with knowing an exact number is that so many languages are being developed each year, as well as ancient languages resurfacing, making it hard to keep track. However, one fact that is known for certain is that not all programming languages are created equal. For example, there may be only around 50 languages that are deemed the “most popular” today.",

Becoming a professional coder is one of the best career decisions you could make because of its flexibility within the tech industry and its extensive and wide-ranging applications. ",
      "This article will delve into what coding is, where coding is used, the types of jobs you can have as a coder, and what the salary range is—from entry-level to an expert coder. ",
      "Coding is the use of computer programming languages to tell a computer or machine what instructions it needs to perform. There are different types of coding languages, and each one is used for a different category of coding. These languages include JavaScript, Python, and others. These programming languages can build computer software systems, programs, websites, mobile apps, and much more. ",
      "Many of the coding languages can be used for the same project. However, some coding languages are commonly used for specific objectives. For example, JavaScript is typically used for website development, whereas Python can be used for website building or computer software programs. ",
      "A coder’s salary estimate depends on your years of experience, where you live, and what category of the tech industry you are working in. The national average for an entry-level coder is $53,000, but depending on your location you can earn an average of up to $80,000 a year. With more experience and a higher job title, the average salary drastically increases. ",
